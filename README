Business Time is a small Android app built to automatically count your work time.

Time counting works by inserting timed events (at_work / not_at_work) into a database. The time periods are calculated from the events.
There are a few unit tests implemented in the TimeManagerTests class to help guarantee that the time calculations are accurate.

Currently the only method to feed events into the database is via WiFi detection: new events are automatically generated when your phone (dis)connects to a pre-configured WiFi network.
Other possible methods of detection would be through the use of bluetooth beacons, NFC, geofences, or a combination of the above. It might also make sense to plug into automation apps such as Llama.

A small to do list:
- UI for creating new events manually
- UI for deleting events
- Notifications
  - Persistant notification while at work
  - Dismissable notification after leaving work
