Business Time is a small Android app that automatically tracks your time at work.

The time tracking works by inserting timed events (at_work / left_work) into a local database. The actual time periods are calculated from the events by counting the time between at_work events and left_work for each working day.
The project includes few unit tests to help guarantee that the time calculations are accurate.

Currently the only method to feed events into the database is via WiFi detection: new events are automatically generated when your phone (dis)connects to a pre-configured WiFi network.
Other possible methods of detection would be through the use of bluetooth beacons, NFC, geofences, or a combination of the above. It might also make sense to plug into automation apps such as Llama.

A small to do list:
- UI for creating new events manually
- UI for deleting events manually
